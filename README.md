## 1.Introduction <a id="1"></a>

The DevOps Project is designed to provide hands-on experience with DevOps principles and tools. It focuses on automating the software development and deployment lifecycle to improve collaboration, efficiency, and quality.

## 2.Features <a id="2"></a>

- Continuous Integration using Jenkins
- Continuous Deployment with Docker and Kubernetes
-  Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
-  Configuration Management with Ansible
-  Monitoring and Logging using Prometheus and Grafana
-  Centralized Logging with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
-  Scalable and Resilient Architecture with Kubernetes
-  Git-based Version Control and Collaboration

## 7.Processes   <a id="7"></a>

| Process | Description | Tools | Metrics | Benefits |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Continuous Integration (CI) | The process of continuously integrating code changes into a shared repository and running automated tests to ensure that the changes are functional and compatible with existing code. | Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI | Build success/failure rate, Test coverage | Faster feedback, Reduced time to detect and fix defects |
| Continuous Delivery (CD) | The process of continuously deploying code changes to production-like environments for testing and verification, with the goal of delivering functional changes to production as soon as possible. | Jenkins, GitLab, Bamboo | Deployment frequency, Mean time to recovery (MTTR) | Faster time-to-market, Reduced risk of failed deployments |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | The process of managing infrastructure through code, enabling versioning, testing, and automated provisioning and deployment of infrastructure resources. | Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible | Deployment success/failure rate, Infrastructure drift | Increased scalability, Reduced manual errors |
| Monitoring and Alerting | The process of collecting and analyzing data from systems and applications to identify issues and trigger alerts, allowing for proactive remediation of problems. | Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios | Mean time to detect (MTTD), Mean time to resolution (MTTR) | Increased availability, Reduced downtime |
| Collaboration and Communication | The process of promoting collaboration and communication between development, operations, and other stakeholders, enabling shared ownership and responsibility for the end-to-end delivery process. | Slack, Microsoft Teams, Jira | Time to resolve issues, Time to deliver features | Increased transparency, Improved team morale |
